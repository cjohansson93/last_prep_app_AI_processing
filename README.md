# CSI-CUE-LSAT-Prep-App

The LSAT has 3 multiple choice sections:
(1) Logical Reasoning 
(2) Analytical Reasoning
(3) Reading Comprehention

  Our natural language processing model is trained on the LSAT multiple choice section for logical reasoning. The model is written in Python, a commonly used programming language favored for its intuitive syntax and diverse liberties for creating AIs. The logical reasoning section has distinct official categories and multiple unofficial subcategories. The resulting AIâ€™s goal is to tie a connection between a question's defined category and the words in the question that are important to that category. 

  This provides a useful study preparation app for prospective test takers to familiarize themselves with types of questions. The app is developed through Flutter, which will allow for multi-platform development. Usefulness is hinged on the ability for these preppers to be exposed to questions with the primary words for category correlation highlighted. The app will enable users to take practice exams, flash card training and other training methods. User data will be stored in a database allowing for proper logins and storing of training progression.

The process involves creating a category dictionary from CSV LSAT dataset. This includes preprocessing text in standard NLP process. This includes lower case, number and punctuation removal, clearing stop words and word lemmatization. Resulting dictionary categories (keys) contain the words with counts (values) for each said category. Dictionary is saved as a categoryDictionary.JSON file.
